ML project predicting diabetes using Pima Indians dataset, with EDA and model evaluation.
# ðŸ©º Diabetes Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset** to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on clinical and personal health features. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
Dataset Source

- [Kaggle: Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- 768 entries with 8 features + 1 outcome label (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)


Project Goals

- Handle missing/invalid values (e.g. 0 glucose, 0 BMI)
- Perform EDA to understand feature distributions
- Train and evaluate ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Measure performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Deliver insights using visuals and metrics

---

Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn (modeling + metrics)
- Google Colab

Model Results

| Metric        | Value (example) |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Accuracy      | 78.6%           |
| Precision     | 0.82            |
| Recall        | 0.81            |
| F1 Score      | 0.76            |
