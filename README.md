ML project predicting diabetes using Pima Indians dataset, with EDA and model evaluation.
# ðŸ©º Diabetes Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset** to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on clinical and personal health features. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
Dataset Source
- [Kaggle: Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- 768 entries with 8 features + 1 outcome label (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)
Project Goals:
- Handle missing/invalid values (e.g. 0 glucose, 0 BMI)
- Perform EDA to understand feature distributions
- Train and evaluate ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Measure performance (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Deliver insights using visuals and metrics
Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Scikit-learn (modeling + metrics)
- Google Colab

Model Results

| Metric        | Value (example) |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Accuracy      | 78.6%           |
| Precision     | 0.82            |
| Recall        | 0.81            |
| F1 Score      | 0.76            |
What I Learned:
How to load and explore real-world datasets using pandas and visualize trends with matplotlib and seaborn.
The importance of data preprocessing, such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and data splitting for training/testing.
Gained hands-on experience in building and evaluating classification models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Decision Trees.
Learned how to use performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
Understood the process of hyperparameter tuning and model selection to improve prediction accuracy.
Strengthened skills in using Jupyter Notebook, Python, and scikit-learn for end-to-end data science workflows.
Developed the ability to draw insights from data and communicate results clearly through visualizations and documentation.
